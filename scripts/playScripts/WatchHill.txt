WATCH HILL By Brooke Tibbs
Setting: Modern Day Suburbia Basement ...and Dog Heaven
At Rise: TAMMY and CHARLIE, middle school- aged kids, are bored in Charlie’s basement. It’s raining outside.
TAMMY I’m bored. Your house is so boring. You need an X-Box. Or, like, an indoor pool.
CHARLIE: We could play Monopoly?
TAMMY Ew. No wonder you don’t have any friends.
CHARLIE: Why don’t you just go home, Tammy?
TAMMY Believe me, I would if I could.  
TAMMY (cont.) Do you have a Ouija board?
CHARLIE: No.  But my sister does.
(Charlie exits and returns with a Ouija board. They quickly set it up.)
TAMMY I heard these were satanic.  You go first.
CHARLIE: Ok, but don’t laugh.
TAMMY I haven’t laughed in like, a month.
CHARLIE: I’d like to see my dog again.
(They wait. TAMMY busts out laughing)
(CHARLIE tackles her.)
CHARLIE: You’re such a liar!
TAMMY (laughing) It’s just, you looked so serious.  Hey, I’m sorry! I’m sorry, ok?  I think you have to ask it a question, so it can answer, like, through us.
CHARLIE: Fine.  Can you show me my dog, Luna?
TAMMY (In response to the board not answering) Bummer.
TOGETHER Y-E-S
CHARLIE: Will you show me my dog, Luna?
TOGETHER Y-E-S
CHARLIE: How?
TOGETHER GO IN THE C-L-O-S-E-T
CHARLIE: Go in the closet?! Are you messing with me?
TAMMY Charlie. I...I didn’t move it. I swear. I think it might be satan.
CHARLIE: If this is some trick to lock me in the closet, then fine. I’d rather be alone anyways.

(CHARLIE goes in the closet and closes the door. He waits. He opens the door and TAMMY is no longer there.)
CHARLIE: Tammy?
(Opens and closes the closet door again)
CHARLIE: Holy Cow - it worked.
(RANDI, quick witted and a little scruffy, enters. She barks a few times and sniffs CHARLIE’S butt.)
(RANDI Barks, calls for charlie)
RANDI: Ooops, sorry, I’ve never had a two-legged visitor.  Welcome to the gates of Dog Heaven, I’m the gatekeeper, Randi.
CHARLIE: Wow. How am I...is that...is that gate made of Bully Sticks?
RANDI: Of course, and a few deer antlers, some tennis balls and dried out pig ears. You hungry?
(RANDI hands CHARLIE a bowl of dog food)
CHARLIE: This is dog food, I couldn’t –
RANDI: It’s dog food in dog Heaven.
(CHARLIE Hesitantly tries it)
CHARLIE: Wow. It takes like butter garlic pizza! And Reese’s Ice Cream! And a fresh rabbit leg... this is delicious!
RANDI: It’s what we give the dogs when they first arrive, because a lot of times...they can’t quite pick up the scent here, so to speak.  When Luna arrived -
CHARLIE: You - You know Luna!? My Luna!?
RANDI: Of course I know your Luna, that sweet girl. When she showed up here, she was...she was sniffing around for you, Charlie, so I gave her some of the same food you’re trying, and she told me -
CHARLIE: You speak dog?
RANDI: Woof woof (of course)
CHARLIE: What did she say!?
RANDI: She said, “This is delicious.  Could I please have some more?”
CHARLIE: That’s my Luna! I always tried to give her table scraps, but my mom –
RANDI: Don’t blame yourself, kid. You can’t beat the food up here. Or the weather. Maybe the conversation - these dogs talk about sniffing butts like it’s the latest episode of Game of Thrones. But anyways, I tried to distract Luna with some chest rubs and a squeaky-bison-flavored rope toy, because even though Luna was transforming into her spirit self, she still had, and still has, a strong connection to you that she didn’t want to let go of. She wasn’t ready to leave you.
CHARLIE: I wasn’t ready either. Well good thing I’m here! I need to see her, where is she?
RANDI: Here, Charlie. Have some water first.
(RANDI hands CHARLIE a water dish.)
CHARLIE: Tastes like...water. 
RANDI: Exactly. Delicious, right?
CHARLIE: Ok - let’s do this! I gotta see my Luna. 
RANDI: Well first...how do I put this. There’s a gate for a reason, kid. If I let you past the oily bully sticks into Dog Heaven, you can’t ever go back to Earth. 
CHARLIE: That sounds...AMAZING! 
RANDI: Oh. Hmmm...I’ll tell you what. I’ll let you have a glimpse into Dog Heaven, and a good long sniff of it too, so you can know what you’re getting into before you make such a permanent decision. You ready? 
(RANDI and CHARLIE enter Dog Heaven)
RANDI: lets him gaze through the gates 
CHARLIE: No way! This is – this is... Look at all the balls for them to fetch! 
RANDI: And they’re all wrapped in bacon. 
CHARLIE: WOW! It’s a tree full of chocolate 
RANDI: And onions 
CHARLIE: And grapes
RANDI: And raisins 
CHARLIE: All the forbidden foods - 
RANDI: Can’t hurt the pups up here. 
CHARLIE: And look at all those cats they’re chasing through the grassy meadow - 
RANDI: With consent from the cats, very unlike earth 
CHARLIE: And over by the lake...is it raining... table scraps?! 
RANDI: Slices of cheese, French bread, filet mignon, every delicious thing a dog ever hoped would drop off the dinner table. 
CHARLIE: Their tails are wagging so much and they, they’re running so...so...they’re so beautiful! 
RANDI: No arthritis up here. Go ahead, kid, take a whiff. 
CHARLIE: MMMMMM It’s like I can see...with my nose! (taking another deep sniff) A rain storm is due in a half hour and there’s a husky and a Chihuahua and a poodle due north – and I
suddenly need to sniff all of their butts. 
RANDI: Sniffing is the new seeing. 
(RANDI and CHARLIE exit Dog Heaven)
CHARLIE: But there aren’t any humans. How can they be so happy without us? 
RANDI: Well, Charlie. Let me tell you the origin of Dog. A long time ago, Wolf told God – God, I want to form a new pack, with man. God said to Wolf, “Wolf - man is unpredictable. He will take you from your mother, put you in chains, morph you into a ball of fluff, and make you fight your own kind to the death - just for sport!  Yes, Wolf said – but give me a chance to change man. I’ll make sure he goes outside every day to play, I’ll comfort him when he’s sick or sad, I’ll be his guide when he cannot see, protect him when he’s in danger, I’ll round up his sheep, I’ll make him laugh just by being me...I’ll love man unconditionally and remind man who he’s supposed to be.  So God said, ok, you crazy wolf. I will transform you into this animal you so desire to be. And because you’ll be an extension of my own pure love, I’ll give you my own name, spelled backwards.  So back to your question. Are the dogs happy without us? Sure, they’re happy because they’re dogs and this is dog heaven. But they were created to care for us, so this place is like a stop over for them, a place for them to play and watch for their humans until they come home. 
CHARLIE: Well, Luna doesn’t have to wait anymore. I’m home, Luna Girl! 
RANDI: Oh, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: You don’t understand. I’m not me without my dog. 
RANDI: But what about your family? 
CHARLIE: My worst enemy is just on the other side of that closet door! And my mom is marrying her dad and now she’s gonna live with me! My dad’s in Arizona, and all my sister cares about is her friends. Luna is my family. 
RANDI: I get it, Charlie. When Cooper died, I couldn’t get out of bed. It hurt and it hurt and it hurt. And I questioned if there was a heaven, but now you know where Luna is, that she’s safe and happy here. 
CHARLIE: Does Cooper live here with you? 
RANDI: Of course! He took the bridge over yonder for a reunion with his littermates and some second cousins, but he’ll be back by dinner. 
CHARLIE: The bridge? 
RANDI: After we enter through the human pearly gates, there’s a Rainbow Bridge that connects human heaven and dog heaven, and one day, Luna will come tearing across to see you – she’ll probably knock you down and lick your face until it’s raw.  Cooper waited here in Dog Heaven for me to finish living my life. She didn’t forget me. She spent a lot of time on Watch Hill, a place where dogs can look down on their humans, just to check in and see what they’re up to.  
CHARLIE: I need to be with my dog now, Randi. I need to feel her breathing next to me through the night, I still need to teach her to play dead – well maybe not that trick, but I need to throw the ball or, better yet, the bacon- wrapped ball to her! I hereby forfeit the rest of my life on earth to be in Dog Heaven! 
RANDI: (Talking to God) Well, I tried. 
RANDI: Ok kid, I’ll go find Luna to welcome you to into Dog Heaven. 
(RANDI eventually comes back without Luna. )
RANDI: Luna won’t see you, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: Why not? 
RANDI: She wants with every hair on her spirit body to run into your arms again, but she knew that would be selfish. And dogs aren’t selfish like us.  She knows that you have your life to live. She goes to Watch Hill every day so she can stay connected to you.  She loves you, Charlie, everything about you from your scent to the way you slurp the milk out of your cereal bowl. And now that you know she’s in good hands, it’s time for you to go home.  
CHARLIE: Wait! You don’t understand. I’m not ok without her. If I can’t stay here, then let her come back to earth. She was only 6 years old when she died.  We didn’t get our time together - 
RANDI: Oh Charlie. But you did. And I almost forgot. Luna wanted me to tell you... there will come a time that you’re ready to get another dog - 
CHARLIE: No. Never! LUUNNNNNAAAA!!!!! 
RANDI: She wants you to know that a good owner like you should have as many dogs as you want. That way, when you get to the bridge, it won’t just be Luna waiting for you, it will be your very own pack. 
CHARLIE: She was too good for earth, wasn’t she? 
RANDI: They all are. 
CHARLIE: How will I go on without her? 
RANDI: When in doubt, be like a dog. Live in the moment. Enjoy the food, even the scraps. Go for long walks. Run and Play. Take naps in the most comfortable spot you can find, and always remember to pester those cats.  

(CHARLIE is back in the closet. TAMMY opens it.)
TAMMY Well?! Did it work? 
CHARLIE: If you’re asking if I got to see my Luna, the answer is no. See ya! 
TAMMY Hey, wait, where are you going? 
CHARLIE: Outside to play. 
TAMMY But it’s raining. 
CHARLIE: Mmmm...rain smells delicious! I can’t wait to sniff it! And I bet there’s puddles I can jump in and water I can lap up. Yum yum yum yum. 
TAMMY But you’ll get all dirty. 
CHARLIE: That’s ok, I’ll just shake it all off. 
TAMMY Wait! Wait a second. Charlie. 
CHARLIE: Yes? 
TAMMY Before you go, it’s only fair if I get to ask the board a question.
CHARLIE: (begrudgingly) Ok, fine. 
(They resume the game.)
CHARLIE: Well. Go ahead. 
TAMMY (Takes a breath) Will you show me my cat?
